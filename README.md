Samsung photo frame control with download ability for Raspberry Zero
=================

A Solution for Samsung photo frame based on [Gekkio/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl](https://github.com/Gekkio/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl)
The intended use is to use Raspberry Pi Zero W in combination with Samsung photo frame to show photos downloaded from the Internet.

The main differences are:
* Added support for second version (firmware 10.08) of SPF-107H.
* Implemented logging
* Added downloading with Curl (Pycurl)
* Added reading from a local folder
* Added PIL for manipulating with pictures
* Added config.py for additional settings
* Added simple gallery with download or local folder option
* Added support for Neopixel Led strip as background ambient light
* Implemented CLI
* Added pluggy plugin system and developed few additional plugins

Features
--------
  
* frame_ctrl.py
  * If the photo frame is in mass storage mode, the program will change it into mini display mode.
  * If the photo frame is in mini display mode, the program will send the jpeg that was specified as the program argument to the photo frame. *The JPEG must be prescaled to the exactly correct size!*
    
* show-image.py
  * Resize and center the image specified as the program argument and call frame_ctrl to show the image
  * Can show text over the image
 
* slideshow.py
  * Fully pluggable slideshow for all supported frames
  * Dummy frame plugin for development
  * Plugin for background LED strip (Neopixel)
  * Plugin for Clocks (shows big clocks at the frame screen)
  * Plugin for Night Mode (Leds are turned off, lower contrast and warmer colors during night)
  * Plugins for image sources:
    * From a local folder
    * From a generic URL
    * From Artsy.net (requires user account and credentials)
    * From Google Photo (currently requires Google Cloud Account)

* txt2img.py 
  * Converts text to image. Output can be piped to show-image.py


Supported photo frames
----------------------

* SPF72H
* SPF75H/76H
* SPF83H
* SPF85H/86H
* SPF85P/86P
* SPF87H old
* SPF105P
* SPF107H
* SPF107H old
* SPF700T


Installation
------------
* clone the repository
* cd samsung-photo-frame-ctrl
* create venv (python -m venv .venv)
* create, check, add or modify settings.toml and .secrets.toml (there is a image setting in settings.toml that might have to be changed)
* .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
* sudo .venv/bin/python3 ./slideshow.py 

Usage
-----

`sudo "pathto"/.venv/bin/python3 "pathto"/slideshow.py`

As the files want to run as root and it seems that you have to put the path in to the .venv it can get awkward

My example startup

sudo /home/pi/git/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl/.venv/bin/python3 /home/pi/git/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl/slideshow.py

While the command below should work on a raspberry pi the rc.local may not be there 

* add `"pathto"/.venv/bin/python3 "pathto"/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl/slideshow.py &` to /etc/rc.local before 'exit 0' row

In default settings there's a remote controller available through web at port 8088


Show IP address(es) with background image Sample command:

python getips.py | python txt2img.py -bi res\wifibg.jpg -o - | python show-image.py (note there is no path on the commands and the res\wifibg.jpg slash direction )

There is also a script folder with sample .sh

Added photo_frame.service

1.Edit the photo_frame.service file for your install.
2. Copy it to /etc/systemd/system:
sudo cp photo_frame.service /etc/systemd/system/
3. Update systemdâ€™s internal data:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
4. Enable your service 
sudo systemctl enable photo_frame.service
5. Start it
sudo systemctl photo_frame.service

I want to try and merge some of https://github.com/mathoudebine/turing-smart-screen-python
